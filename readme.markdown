AngularJS + Browserify Project Template
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/basti1302/angular-browserify.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular-browserify/traverson)

This is a small example/seed project for using AngularJS with Browserify. It demonstrates how to structure code by using CommonJS modules together with AngularJS' dependency injection mechanism.

Build
-----

This project comes with a `gulpfile` that includes:

* running ESlint to lint JavaScript sources,
* running unit tests via Mocha,
* processing sources with Browserify (to create a non-minfied Browserify bundle),
* ngAnnotate & uglify (to create an ngAnnotate-processed and minified Browserify bundle),
* end-to-end tests with Protractor,
* a static asset server (gulp-connect) and
* live reload support.

### Useful gulp tasks

The
* `gulp fast`:
    * linting
    * unit tests
    * browserification
    * no minification, does not start server
* `gulp watch`
    * starts server with live reload enabled
    * lints, unit tests, browserifies and live-reloads changes in browser
    * no minification
* `gulp`:
    * linting
    * unit tests
    * browserification
    * minification and browserification of minified sources
    * start server for e2e tests
    * run Protractor End-to-end tests
    * stop server immediately when e2e tests have finished

At development time, you should usually just have `gulp watch` running in the background all the time. Access the app via http://localhost:8080/. Whenever you change a source file and save it, the browserify bundle is recreated and your browser automatically reloads the changes. Use `gulp` (without a specific task) before releases.
